We had a good neighborhood turnout at the planning commission meeting. Rene Spring took a strong stance against the project, but the other members of the commission would like to see development move forward in a more limited fashion. The commissioners asked staff to draft a new MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) with a limit of 22 homes in the development on smaller, clustered, lots to more closely match the neighboring development and reduce the impact on the viewshed. The lots would not exceed the 10% grade line, not just the buildings per the current plan. Voting on the MOU and urban service area boundary changes were tabled until the next meeting.

There were other details requested for the new MOU but I will have to wait until the minutes are posted before detailing. We plan to continue the fight to prevent annexation all together. The next planning commission meeting is July 28th at 7:00PM. Please join us and tell the planning commission what preserving our viewshed means to you If you haven't yet, please sign our petition and spread the word, together we can Save Morgan Hill!

_Note: Petition is now closed._
