Morgan Hill City Council Meeting
The Oak Meadow Project is on the agenda for the Morgan Hill City Council meeting, this coming Sept. 2nd, 7:00 PM, at City Hall. Please attend, wear your green shirt if you have one, and fill out a speaker card if you would like to say a few words.

The vote at this meeting will decide if the project is able to move forward to the county for review. Just 3 council members will decide if Measure C is upheld and the hillside and agricultural land is preserved, or if this development moves forward. Make your voice heard!

I you would like to purchase a sign or shirt, contact [Aleks Vranicic](mailto:av@1791.com).
