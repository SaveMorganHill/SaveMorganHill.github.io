We had a good turnout at the September 2nd city council meeting. It was great to see all the green shirts! The vote was close but we prevailed 3 -2 denying the request to expand the urban services area boundary. This also killed the MOU. We'd like to thank Mayor Steve Tate and Council Members Larry Carr and Gordon Siebert for their support. We hope that Council Members Rich Constantine and Marilyn Librers will be more supportive of smart growth in future decisions.

The video from the meeting is worth watching if you were unable to attend. It can be found here.

[SaveMorganHill.org](http://SaveMorganHill.org) isn't done yet. We'll be updating the website in the coming weeks with information about our next steps to help ensure that Morgan Hill grows in a responsible manner.
