**RE: AREA 1: TENNANT-MURPHY - MORGAN HILL URBAN SERVICE AREA AMENDMENT 2015**

Dear LAFCO Commission,

The Save Morgan Hill organization is a movement started by residents of Morgan Hill who are focused on responsibly growing the city of Morgan Hill as called for in our General Plan.

The City of Morgan Hill’s request for annexation of 229 acres of the Southeast Quadrant (SEQ) for sports and recreation uses will cause premature and unnecessary growth that runs counter to the City’s General Plan and LAFCO policies.  It would unduly affect South County’s quality of life through loss of farmland and burden us with lower levels of urban service while increasing traffic congestion on Highway 101, city streets, and county roads.

Recently, the county was awarded a $100,000 Sustainable Agricultural Lands Conservation Program Grant.  The Grant was awarded to develop a regional framework that connects farmland preservation with climate change mitigation efforts in Morgan Hill, Gilroy and Coyote Valley.

Given the upcoming study and repeated concerns from Morgan Hill citizens to preserve the desired amount of open space, the Save Morgan Hill organization calls on the Commission to deny this annexation request.


Sincerely,

Save Morgan Hill\\
